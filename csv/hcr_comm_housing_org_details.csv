CGA has developed programs that have addressed the needs of the working class neighborhoods of South Brooklyn. Programs benefitting low- and moderate-income individuals and families include landlord/tenant counseling and assistance in filing applications for assisted housing (Section 8 and Housing Authority.) CGA offers assistance and technical services to small property owners and rehabilitation funds for property management. When Carroll Gardens began experiencing its first wave of gentrification, they began to explore the need for affordable housing to ease displacement of long time residents because of exorbitant rent increases. CGA is the recipient of two John Heinz Neighborhood Demonstration Program Awards totaling $125,000. This award has a highly competitive application process and is funded through HUD. CGA is funded yearly by the Department of Youth and Community Development to operate an after school computer training program. Collaborative work with other non-profits and community groups includes projects with the Enterprise Foundation, National Equity Fund, National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Puerto Rican Coalition and the Statewide Hispanic Corp.

They include but are not limited to Heart of the City and Hispanics United of Buffalo.  Under this agreement, their staff does the application intake and we underwrite and fund the loan. WSNHS is also administering a $485,000.00 grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank for exterior repairs thru out the City.  We have received numerous requests for partner loans to complete projects. For example, if a roof needs repair and the maximum grant is $4,850.00, but the cost of the repair is $8,000.00, we are funding the difference from our NeighborWorks® America revolving loan fund. These loans have been extended throughout the City limits. West Side Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc. is a HUD certified counseling agency, and we are the only agency certified to give secondary financing to FHA mortgages. Our homeownership education prepares potential first-time home buyers with classes explaining the process of obtaining a mortgage and how to avoid predatory lenders. We offer credit counseling to correct outstanding financial issues that may hinder their getting a conventional mortgage. We also provide technical advice and rehabilitation loans to encourage families to stay in their homes. West Side Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc. does this by inspecting the property and then processing a loan application. The loan would cover any and all City of Buffalo building code violations. On a smaller scale, we have instituted a Minor Home Repair program. The guidelines for this program are that the homeowner purchases the supplies and we pay a repair person to do the labor. West Side Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc. also has an Emergency Program to address an immediate need such as a broken furnace or water line. Due to a lack of funding, we no longer offer a security program. We are aggressive in offering first mortgages to families that are working to become homeowners, but their credit scores are too low, or the value of the house is not enough to go to a regular lending institution.

They have a strong tenant advocacy program with over 130 cases per year.  A prevailing community need and top priority for the Board is rehabilitating the current housing stock (98% of units were constructed prior to 1978.)  Amsterdam has the oldest-per-capita population in the State of New York.  Rehabilitation efforts are focused on the elderly population's homes.  In early years, 1994 and 1995, two small RESTORE grants assisted over 18 elderly homeowners with emergency repairs.  With the first HOME grant, 35 homes were rehabilitated for elderly homeowners, at an average of only $9,857 per home.  The second HOME grant rehabilitated a total of 37 units - more than the original estimate because active networking and community development made it possible to join forces with other agencies to rehabilitate additional homes with limited funding."
