      "description": "Crown Heights Jewish Community Council (CHJCC) is a private, nonprofit social service agency serving one of the most diverse and challenging neighborhoods in New York City. The agency was formed in 1969 in response to deteriorating social and economic conditions in the neighborhood. The population of the 116-city block cache area known as Crown Heights is comprised of persons of many cultures and includes new immigrants.  According to the 1990 census, incomes tend to be low - often below poverty levels.  Housing is mostly old (circa 1900 - 1930) and at a premium. CHJCC administers programs, advocates for clients, and provides referrals on issues of housing, employment, economic development, entitlements, problems of the aging, aid to crime victims, assistance for indigent residents. CHJCC has created multi-racial, faith, and community-based programs such as Project Care, which unites civic and religious leaders from every segment of the community in a funded program to promote efforts in social and economic development. Creative initiatives such as Project Care have addressed areas of common concern, and new avenues of communication and cooperation have emerged. One of the major goals of the CHJCC is to promote an atmosphere of understanding and cooperation in the community.  Areas of common concern, including housing, poverty, crime, employment, education and economic development, are being addressed through new programs."

The association was organized in 1976 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1979 by a group of community leaders who were concerned about the negative effects of crime, drugs, lack of employment opportunities, abandonment, poor quality of housing, and bank disinvestment in the area. The Association was created with the view of collaborating in a recuperating strategy for the community; aspiring to develop tenants potential through meaningful workshops in leadership; to organize tenants; secure housing from negligent landlords; promote neighborhood stability; and provide low-income housing. The services and activities are based upon the conviction that in order to effectively control housing problems, the neighborhood residents themselves must become involved. The Association promotes a self-help approach in attending other needs arising from poverty levels characterizing vast sectors of the community. The examination of the issues of the community and the individual person in a holistic way has led to a web of interrelations with other community organizations in order to improve the quality assistance offered to housing, schools, churches, hospitals, police, fire departments and other service providers in the area. The organizational relationship avoids repetitive efforts and economic redundancy. The Association provides independent living skills workshops to the community on various topics such as: Lead Awareness-Local Law 1, management, crime prevention (trespassing program), arson awareness, the operation of tenants associations and health issues.  Through NYC HPD's  Anti-Abandonment Unit- Community Consultant Program, the association offers walk-in services for: case management, counseling services, tenant counseling on apartment maintenance, referrals to suitable housing, employment and education, assistance with applications for Public Housing, Section 8 and Public Assistance, rent arrears application, DRIE (Disability Rent Increase Exempt), Con Edison /Heartshare (grant for individuals who are in distress and in arrears with electrical/gas bill, this program is seasonal), and protecting their legal rights. The association's most recent contract with NYC HPD's Anti-Abandonment Unit as an NPC provides surveys to buildings in housing code violations; assists landlords to get into voluntary repair agreements, repair loans, building maintenance and other programs to be eligible for tax breaks; mediation with both landlord and tenant dispossession and evictions; technical assistance to residents of city owned buildings; and management and financial services assistance to buildings already converted to Cooperatives. Services are provided to Seniors to motivate them to secure and maintain entitlement benefits and assist with their physical, psychological and social well being. The organization assists with various programs accessible for seniors such as referral to suitable housing placement, SCRIE, HEAP, IT210 & IT214 tax rebates, Medicare/Medicaid, Home care referral and social cultural/ recreational programs."

As the commercial revitalization activities of the Astoria Restoration Association continued, which included the completion of a 1.7 million dollar physical improvement project for the area, it soon became apparent that housing deterioration had to be addressed before it developed into a more serious problem.  Thus in 1981, the ARA began a comprehensive housing and neighborhood revitalization program aimed at strengthening the existing housing stock of the neighborhood.  The goals of the Astoria Restoration Association, as stated in the Articles of Incorporation are to \"preserve the stability of the residential and the commercial areas of the community; encourage landlords, homeowners, and businessmen to improve their property, stimulate public interest in the arts and cultural endeavors related to the preservation of the community; and to coordinate with government agencies to improve the community.\"  With these goals as a base, the ARA has and will continue to implement an on-going Neighborhood Preservation Program consisting of three majors components: 1) Housing 2) Neighborhood Economic Development 3) Neighborhood Employment Service."

CGA has developed programs that have addressed the needs of the working class neighborhoods of South Brooklyn. Programs benefitting low- and moderate-income individuals and families include landlord/tenant counseling and assistance in filing applications for assisted housing (Section 8 and Housing Authority.) CGA offers assistance and technical services to small property owners and rehabilitation funds for property management. When Carroll Gardens began experiencing its first wave of gentrification, they began to explore the need for affordable housing to ease displacement of long time residents because of exorbitant rent increases. CGA is the recipient of two John Heinz Neighborhood Demonstration Program Awards totaling $125,000. This award has a highly competitive application process and is funded through HUD. CGA is funded yearly by the Department of Youth and Community Development to operate an after school computer training program. Collaborative work with other non-profits and community groups includes projects with the Enterprise Foundation, National Equity Fund, National Low Income Housing Coalition, National Puerto Rican Coalition and the Statewide Hispanic Corp. CGA is rehabilitating and refurbishing 62 units of housing in Red Hook and developing a HomeWork housing program."

Center City is the only HUD Certified Housing Counseling Agency in Niagara County and therefore provides housing counseling and education to anyone in need regardless of neighborhood.

At that time, entire buildings, even entire blocks of the neighborhood were abandoned, sometimes as a result of suspected arson.  The first work of the largely volunteer organization was to organize tenants to collect their own rent and to run their own buildings.  In 1972 Southside United HDFC was incorporated and in 1979 Los Sures Community Development was incorporated to further the work and goals of the organization."

MBSCC's Job Resource Center has two full time employees and an additional Job/Business Development position was funded. As more community residents become employed, the need for child care service have greatly increased.  MBSCC has been able to increase child care service by securing funding from the Board of Education for the provision of Universal Pre-Kindergarten services to 80 children.  This program began in September of 1999.  Also four new day care classrooms have been completed that will house a total of 68 children.  Additional funding has been secured from the NYC Board of Education to provide Universal Pre-Kindergarten to serve 56 children. During the past three years,  MBSCC has involved community residents through it's Neighborhood Advisory Council (NAC) in negotiating with NYC Department of Design Construction for the construction of a community friendly Bronx Supreme Court building.  As a result of the negotiating, a High School of Law and Justice and a day care center for 140 children will be built adjacent to the new Supreme Court Building. The construction of the Family Preservation Center (FPC) at the Andrew Freedman Home is near completion.  The FPC will house a number of programs offering job development, social services, day care, pediatric serviced, etc. to community residents.  Also, a number of other social service agencies will be housed at the FPC on a rotating basis to ensure that the greatest variety of services can be provided to community residents. The provision  of qualify housing to community residents of Bronx Planning #4 continues to be a very important goal of MBSCC."

After two submissions to the NYSHTF we were unable to get the funds to develop housing for low income residents at 2249 2nd Avenue site. We have been forced to surrender the idea of developing low income housing, and are now in the process of developing moderate income condominiums ( 32 Units) at 2249 2nd Avenue (Block 1665, Lot 24 & 25) in order to support our low income buildings. In the past and current years we have supported and maintained our low income buildings with rent and funds generated from 119 East 102nd street, a section 8 project. Our future strategy is to build these condominiums in order to generate funds from the sales therefore allowing N.E.R.V.E Inc. to become more self sufficient."

Through its development efforts, SEBCO has obtained extensive experience undertaking renovation and rehabilitation work in occupied multi-family buildings and is consistently recognized as one of New York City's top subsidized housing developers.

As of June 2000, SEBCO has been involved in the creation of 63 apartment buildings and 358 private homes, coops, and condos. This represents a total of 2,991 housing units. Close to 3,000 families are living in permanent housing that SEBCO has developed over the past 32 years. SEBCO's focus is not limited to physical housing but in improving all aspects of the community. We provide over 130 hot meals in our Department for the Aging sponsored senior center; our computer learning center prepares community residents for the workplace.

The mission of SEIC is to aid, assist and foster the planning, development, renewal and improvement of housing conditions in the South End Environs area in the City of Albany, New York;  thereby encouraging city living and the preservation of the residential and commercial character of the area. The service area encompasses approximately 10% of the entire population of Albany, which Albany's population is nearly 95,000 residents. SEIC supports several active neighborhood associations/groups, such as: South End Neighborhood Association (SENA), Delaware Avenue Neighborhood Association (DANA), Lincoln Park, Mt. Hope Townhouse, Krank Park, the Pastures and the Mansion association. These groups conduct regular meetings, organize community activities which promote social interaction, support the improvement of quality of life issues for the South End residents and work in conjunction with SEIC to improve, preserve and stabilize the neighborhoods of its community. SEIC also provides assistance through its Home Maintenance and Security program (\"SHIP aka HMS\"). This assistance is offered to low-moderate income homeowners, as established by HUD income guidelines. The SHIP program affords homeowners up to $1,000 for repairs to their owner occupied houses. In addition, SEIC provides home buyer education and support for tenants with an active interest in purchasing a home as a first time home buyer in the South End. SEIC was the marketing agent for the Frederick Douglass Affordable Housing Program, which was offered through the Albany Housing Authority as the lead agency, and Charles Touhey's company as the developer. Through the collaborative efforts of these two organizations, 15 new homes were built in the South End, placing families of modest means into home ownership for the first time! In addition, SEIC has nearly completed its second RESTORE program. Through RESTORE, 14 Senior owner occupied houses in the community were assisted with emergency repairs. SEIC, through its OUTREACH program provided assistance (and follow-up communication) with its Senior Citizens and other community members. This service includes, but is not limited to, home maintenance assistance, social services support which ensures that senior homeowners, low income homeowners, senior tenants and low income tenants, are receiving all eligible services available to them through programs such as: Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), heath care assistance, and the Meals on Wheels  food program. Last, but not least, SEIC has a new homeowner rehabilition program called HARP. Through HARP, SEIC will rehabilitate 13 units for folks of  modest means who own and occupy their homes. The maximum assistance is $19,156.00 per unit. One unit  was completed during this program year."

The Alfred Housing Committee offers a full range of housing services including rehabilitation, tenants rights, and new construction, and is the community development arm of the municipalities in their service area.  They have developed infrastructure; prepared documentation for inclusion in the recently expanded Empire Zones in Wellsville and Alfred; upgraded municipal water and sewer systems; and installed new systems, accessing federal and state resources with an eye toward \"affordability.\"  A $300,000 Strategic Initiative grant allowed a water project in the Town of Wellsville to become a reality after 15 years of frustration for municipal officials and low-income residents.  Alfred has secured a land donation for the development of an industrial park, and administers a municipal revolving loan fund that encourages business creation and job development through low interest loans.  Federal funding made possible a joint comprehensive plan for the Town and Village of Wellsville which will be a living document reflecting the changing needs of the municipalities and, more importantly, will be the touchstone for new development in the future.  Alfred Housing Committee has made a significant impact on the substandard housing in all six municipalities in its service area, continuing  the long-standing program of housing rehabilitation through the NYS Affordable Housing Corporation.  The average owner-occupied housing rehabilitation project cost is $12,500.  Sixty percent of this cost is a grant to the homeowner who must provide the remaining 40%, with Alfred assisting them to obtain  the additional funds through loan packaging, usually with USDA/RD's 502/504 Housing Rehabilitation program or other loan and grant programs."

Family development services include an emergency shelter for victims of domestic violence, a food pantry, a 24-hour emergency hotline, homelessness prevention and a Respite Program, which provides short-term residential care for children with emotional or developmental disabilities.  The Friendship Empire Zone has recently expanded and now includes portions of Wellsville and Alfred as well as the original parts of Friendship and Cuba.  ACCORD created the Allegany Community Development Services, Inc. (ACDSI), a small and emerging Community Development Finance Institution (CDFI).  ACDSI is a non-profit corporation which addresses the education, business, and housing credit needs of low-income persons in Allegany and Cattaraugus Counties.  Highlights of the infant, child and youth services include:  Programs aimed at youth who are parenting, pregnant, or at risk of pregnancy; Child Care Resource and Referral; Advantage After School; and Head Start and Early Head Start."

All of these programs serve low-income families and individuals (households with incomes at 80% or less of median).   The staff also provides a fair amount of technical assistance to local municipalities and other not-for-profit and for-profit groups in the planning of new programs and services, in the development of new rental projects, and in the preparation of grant applications for funding."

Owning a home strengthens the stability of families, and CMHDC focuses on increasing home ownership through their programs.

Greene County is one of a few areas where home ownership is within the financial reach of low- and moderate-income families.  This favorable market coupled with the opportunities provided by CMHDC has had a positive impact on the future of housing in the area.  Greene County also has a disproportionate share of older New Yorkers.  Assisting elderly homeowners by promoting home repair assistance programs and providing funds for a variety of code related repairs keeps them in comfortable, safe and affordable homes.  CMHDC works with other public and private agencies to leverage funds for these needed repairs.  They also provide senior housing for renters.  Three sites make a total of 80 units available to low-income seniors.  Striving to play an even more vital role in the senior community, CMHDC has received funding to add two new residences in their rural mountain communities and continues to seek opportunities to serve this population."

Western Catskills administers grants to first-time home buyers through the Affordable Housing and HOME Programs to assist families with the purchase of their first homes and grant funds to assist low/mod income families with much needed repairs and renovations to their homes with funding provided by The New York State Affordable Housing Corporation, The New York State Housing Trust Fund Corporation (HOME), and the CDBG program. Western Catskills has provided assistance to various townships, villages, and hamlets with water and sewer projects, storm water control projects, and applications for funding from local foundations and government agencies.

Decent, sanitary, and safe rental housing construction was the priority.  A total of  24 units of apartments were completed under Rural Development 515 program.  A 5-year Master Plan was developed.  Indian Health Services provided funds through the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe to extend the waterline and construct a waste water treatment plant. The Rural Area Revitalization Program provided funds to lay a sewer main connecting all the projects to the new  waste water treatment plant.  A 30 unit rental program was sponsored by MIHC to construct a 202/Section 8 in 1889 for the elderly and handicapped.  An Enriched Housing Program was designed to complement the 202/Sec. 8 rental program by assisting residents with day-to-day care. Starting in 1985 to present, MIHC provides rental management and has 82 units under management.  From 1991 until present, a Summer Youth Program and an After School Tutor and Recreation program has been sponsored under the Community Services Block Grant.  The CSBG program funds a driver under the DOT Section 5310 Program for the elderly and handicapped transportation. The NYS-DHCR awarded a HOME award of $400,000 to enable 25 owner occupied renovations from 1997-99. The DHCR-RPP Incentive Award allowed our office to hire two part-time employees to assist with the many new programs that have been funded for this year."

Project S.H.A.R.E. (Senior Housing at Reduced Expense) has provided safe and affordable shared housing opportunities for over 28 years for low-income seniors and disabled persons.  This program includes both agency-managed apartments in which three to four persons live cooperatively  in a residence maintained by Richmond Senior Services, and housing in the homes of senior homeowners who are willing to share their homes for the benefits of companionship and financial contribution to the household.  Both these opportunities are viable options in the ever-increasing costs of the rental market.  The Access to Home program provides home modifications  to low-income disabled persons to allow them safe access in, out and throughout their homes.  The addition of ramps, lifts, visual acuity and other modifications assures their full access to their community and needed services, and helps them to remain at home rather than in an institution.  The Senior Repair Program is a  home repair service that offers minor health and safety related home repairs for seniors and disabled persons.  This program covers the small, but otherwise costly, repairs that seniors cannot complete themselves due to lack of income or physical capabilities.    Hundreds of repairs are completed each year.  Our advocacy, information and referral,  entitlement counseling and application assistance also assist seniors and disabled persons in maintaining their independence in the community by accessing all possible services, including housing, adult education, emergency food supplies, and other housing repair services.  A senior food pantry provides emergency food to seniors and disabled persons each month who are experiencing difficulty in meeting household expenses.  Recipients of the food supplies also receive pre-screening for food stamps, entitlement screenings, housing and  job counseling, case assistance and information and referral.  The program encourages a nutritionally sound diet, while also alleviating some demands upon their financial resources."

(HHCA) was organized in 1977 and incorporated in 1978 for the purpose of serving the minority community at three different levels: housing, education, and civic activities. A community-based organization working to promote the welfare of those resident in the Village of Hempstead by creating positive change in neighborhoods struggling with disinvestment, poverty, and neglect. Over the years, HHCA has developed 90 units of housing for rental and homeownership purposes and has converted a number of tenants into landlords. HHCA has utilized the Community Developments Block Grant, AHC, HUD 203K, and private capital to fund these developments. We will be using Federal Home Loan Bank, and we will submit Housing Trust Fund application to expand our program and the funding track record of our organization. The improvement and preservation of our traditional neighborhood will be accomplished by providing the following activities and services: educational homeownership counseling, loan pre-qualification, mortgage counseling, and loan/grant assistance to lower closing cost. We also organize tenants, assist tenant associations, and hold seminars and workshops on tenant rights and responsibilities, housing court, filing complaint forms, and procedures of the Rent Administration Office."

Due to the increased demand for our services, we have signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with housing agencies outside of our immediate area.  They include but are not limited to Heart of the City and Hispanics United of Buffalo.  Under this agreement, their staff does the application intake and we underwrite and fund the loan. WSNHS is also administering a $485,000.00 grant from the Federal Home Loan Bank for exterior repairs thru out the City.  We have received numerous requests for partner loans to complete projects. For example, if a roof needs repair and the maximum grant is $4,850.00, but the cost of the repair is $8,000.00, we are funding the difference from our NeighborWorks® America revolving loan fund. These loans have been extended throughout the City limits. West Side Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc. is a HUD certified counseling agency, and we are the only agency certified to give secondary financing to FHA mortgages. Our homeownership education prepares potential first-time home buyers with classes explaining the process of obtaining a mortgage and how to avoid predatory lenders. We offer credit counseling to correct outstanding financial issues that may hinder their getting a conventional mortgage. We also provide technical advice and rehabilitation loans to encourage families to stay in their homes. West Side Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc. does this by inspecting the property and then processing a loan application. The loan would cover any and all City of Buffalo building code violations. On a smaller scale, we have instituted a Minor Home Repair program. The guidelines for this program are that the homeowner purchases the supplies and we pay a repair person to do the labor. West Side Neighborhood Housing Services, Inc. also has an Emergency Program to address an immediate need such as a broken furnace or water line. Due to a lack of funding, we no longer offer a security program. We are aggressive in offering first mortgages to families that are working to become homeowners, but their credit scores are too low, or the value of the house is not enough to go to a regular lending institution. Our Executive Director is still an active member of the Save Our Streets Committee to help rid absentee landlord properties of drug activity."

A prevailing community need and top priority for the Board is rehabilitating the current housing stock (98% of units were constructed prior to 1978.)  Amsterdam has the oldest-per-capita population in the State of New York.  Rehabilitation efforts are focused on the elderly population's homes.  In early years, 1994 and 1995, two small RESTORE grants assisted over 18 elderly homeowners with emergency repairs.  With the first HOME grant, 35 homes were rehabilitated for elderly homeowners, at an average of only $9,857 per home.  The second HOME grant rehabilitated a total of 37 units - more than the original estimate because active networking and community development made it possible to join forces with other agencies to rehabilitate additional homes with limited funding."
